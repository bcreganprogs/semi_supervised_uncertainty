# semi_supervised_uncertainty
This is the github repo for Object Respresentation Learning in Uncertainty Aware Image Segmentation. This repo applies a fixed version of Probabilistic Slot Attention to image embeddings to generate vector representations of objects. These representations are then used for downstream segmentation and reconstruction tasks.

Requirements to run this code:
Python 3.10
Environment created by installing requirements.txt file
Adjust paths in bash scrits and run bash *script_name.sh
